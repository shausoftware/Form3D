# Form3D
An old interactive geometry generator loosely based on Form by Andrew Rowbottom. Built using the Unity Game Engine V3. This may not be the best example of Unity development as I am not really using it in it's intended manner. All physics are switched off and I'm using OO to generate Game Objects rather than adding them to the scene graph.

To get started run the project and press 'H' for help and a summary of keyboard controls.
