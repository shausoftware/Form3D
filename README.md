# Form3D
An interactive geometry generator loosely based on Form by Andrew Rowbottom. Built using the Unity Game Engine. This may not be the best example of Unity development as I am not really using it in it's intended manner. All physics are switched off and I'm using OO to generate Game Objects rather than adding them to the scene graph.
